== Control, estimation, optimization \n

=== Distributed optimization (Spring 2011, UC Berkeley) \n
The advent of massive data sets and hugely parallel computing offers novel opportunities for distributed optimization. While much of the theory underpinning this area has been around for decades, there has been tremendous progress (and new challenges!) recently, and it is time to offer a new look at the subject.
First, the class explores recent advances in first-order methods for convex optimization, which constitute the main building block for many of the more advanced algorithms developed later. Second, the class focuses on algorithms for distributed optimization under computation and communication constraints. Our starting point here is mathematical decomposition techniques traditionally developed for exploiting structure in large-scale optimization. The resulting algorithms are applicable to a cluster of collocated computers under centralized coordination. We then discuss algorithms that allow for inaccurate computations and delayed or restricted communication, as well as cooperative and non-cooperative algorithms for distributed optimization in the absence of centralized control. These algorithms are applicable to a cloud of distributed computers with partial and possibly time-varying communication, and to networks of devices found in communication systems and robotics. \n
