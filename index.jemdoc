I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at the University of California, Berkley.
I work with Professor [http://lagrange.ce.berkeley.edu/bayen/ Alex Bayen] and Professor [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/ Pieter Abbeel] 
on the [http://traffic.berkeley.edu Mobile Millennium project] in the Intelligent Systems, Control, and Robotics Area ([http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Areas/CIR/ CIR]). 
My research interests span statistical models and optimization, control and estimation theory, with applications to traffic estimation and pattern learning from GPS probe vehicle.
